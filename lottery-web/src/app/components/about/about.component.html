                    <p>You can withdraw your WalletSpace money to your bank account and cash out at ATM or your bank branch.  If you chose to get a pre-paid debit card issued by certain digital wallet providers (such as Wirex, SpectroCoin), you may withdraw your cash only at ATMs (might not be available in certain countries).</p>
                    <p><i><u>Note:</u> All steps until cash withdrawal are performed online. Transaction speed is determined by specific services availability and load, but usually operations happen immediately.</i></p>
