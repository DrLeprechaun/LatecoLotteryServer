        <p>The prize is transferred to winner’s WalletSpace account automatically.<p>
        <p><i><u>Note:</u> Tokens are purchased for SJP cryptocurrency with an exchange rate of 1:1.</i></p>
        <p><i><u>Note:</u> Please be aware that the lottery service owners are only responsible for Gambling Tokens level. Service owners do not take any responsibility for cryptocurrencry and fiat transactions.</i></p>

        <p>To play the lottery, you will have to buy at least one ticket. Tickets are purchased for gambling tokens. Tokens are bought for SJP cryptocurrency at 1:1 exchange rate, with SJP coming from  your WalletSpace account. Use WalletSpace account tools (which are also available right from the lottery service portal) to top up wallet balance with your debit card and convert it to SJP.</p>
        <p>Should you win, the payoff will be automatically transferred to your WalletSpace account in SJP. Winner has several options for managing funds:<br/>
        <span style="margin-left: 10px;">a.	Transfer funds to a digital wallet with crypto support (Wirex, SpectroCoin) and order a debit card issued by the wallet provider.</span><br/>
        <span style="margin-left: 10px;">b.	Use the exchange feature of your WalletSpace account to convert the funds to one of available crypto or fiat currencies. </span><br/>
        <span style="margin-left: 10px;">c.	Convert WalletSpace funds using third party exchange services. Transaction time depends on the service, but usually does not exceed 30 minutes.</span></p>
        <p>You can withdraw your WalletSpace money to your bank account and cash out at ATM or your bank branch.  If you chose to get a pre-paid debit card issued by certain digital wallet providers (such as Wirex, SpectroCoin), you may withdraw your cash only at ATMs (might not be available in certain countries).</p>
        <p><i><u>Note:</u> All steps until cash withdrawal are performed online. Transaction speed is determined by specific services availability and load, but usually operations happen immediately.</i></p>
