                      The minimum guaranteed Jackpot is 2100 SJP. It is accumulative. First, fixed winnings are calculated. After that, the rest of the Prize pool is divided equally between the categories Prize and Jackpot. If there were no Winners in these two categories, then the Prize pools of these categories will be transferred to the next draw Jackpot Prize pool.
